         <p class="one"><span class="ano">..Designers don’t read..</span><br>
There's actually a book called Designers Don't Read, written by Fredrik Averin, Austin Howe. In the book Howe explores the creative process and conceptualization, and delves into what to do when inspiration is lacking. </p>
         
       <p class="two"><span class="ano">..New York School..</span><br>
The New York School was an informal group of American poets, painters, dancers, and musicians active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements. </p>
         
        <p class="three"><span class="ano">..Pictorial Modernism ..</span><br>
This term could refer to earlier statements " an enormous amount of graphic design is made by people who look at pictures but don’t know how to think about them". </p>
         
     <p class="four"><span class="ano">..What we don’t see, in effect, didn’t exist..</span><br>
Same concept with some people like to keep contact with people with similar background or same ethnicity who they can identify with while leaving the rest with a group stereotypes in their mind based on stories they have heard. </p>
     <p class="five"><span class="ano">..What we see through this lens becomes the design we know, and remember, and admire..</span><br>
 luxury products like Gucci, LV those luxury brands are the names many people know and chase after, while they could easily choose a smaller brand with cheaper price but better design. </p>
       <p class="six"><span class="ano">..Graphic design isn’t so easily defined or limited..</span><br>
 postmodern context has added diversity and complexity into graphic design. </p> 
     <p class="seven"><span class="ano">..It (Graphic design) isn’t a profession, it’s a medium..</span><br>
 Graphic designer creates a bridge for one end to reach broader audiences, no matter it's a product, commodity, political message, or a brand name, their work itself acts as a way to communicate. </p> 
       <p class="eight"><span class="ano">..Design history creates boundaries..</span><br>
 It seems contradictive with earlier statement "They write captions. Sometimes they write really long captions, thousands of words that do nothing but describe the pictures." It seems they encourage historian to "teach people how to think", but now they are saying they are subjective when they "create boundaries". </p>
