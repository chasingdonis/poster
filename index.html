         <p class="one"><span class="ano">Designers don’t read</span><br>
There's actually a book called Designers Don't Read, written by Fredrik Averin, Austin Howe. In the book Howe explores the creative process and conceptualization, and delves into what to do when inspiration is lacking. </p>
         
       <p class="two"><span class="ano">New York School</span><br>
The New York School was an informal group of American poets, painters, dancers, and musicians active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements. </p>
         
        <p class="three"><span class="ano">Pictorial Modernism</span><br>
This term could refer to earlier statements " an enormous amount of graphic design is made by people who look at pictures but don’t know how to think about them". </p>
         
     <p class="four"><span class="ano">how history is written affects how the past is seen and understood</span><br>
Asking questions will be a good way to have critical thinking while reading, listening, or looking at historical materials. Historians usually show us in a narrow way about the past, and if we don't question we will blindly follow them into whatever way they lead us to. History usually avoids something and emphasizes the others, we need to look at it from all the angles that will lead us to have a more completed view. </p>
     <p class="five"><span class="ano">historical stuff with no historical context</span><br>
 https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-historical-context-1857069
In this article, author Grace Fleming claims the importance of understanding historical context in analyzing and interpreting literature. She redefines the historical context more clearly -"historical context refers to the social, religious, economic, and political conditions that existed during a certain time and place. Basically, it's all the details of the time and place in which a situation occurs, and those details are what enable us to interpret and analyze works or events of the past, or even the future, rather than merely judge them by contemporary standards."</p>
       <p class="six"><span class="ano">Graphic design isn’t so easily defined or limited</span><br>
 postmodern context has added diversity and complexity into graphic design. </p> 
     <p class="seven"><span class="ano">It (Graphic design) isn’t a profession, it’s a medium</span><br>
 Graphic designer creates a bridge for one end to reach wider audiences, no matter it's a product, commodity, political message, or a brand name, their work itself acts as a way to communicate. </p> 
       <p class="eight"><span class="ano">which they view design-and we view design</span><br>
 Argument between nature and nurture. In nurtural point of view, parental and educational perspective would decide how we view the world.
 </p> 
         <p class="nine"><span class="ano">History came back as well</span><br>
 The remake of Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977) movie is coming back in early November 2018. The production design, the 70s' horror, and the story will come back with a new look but not detached from the historian influences.
 </p> 
         <p class="ten"><span class="ano">Visual literacy is important, but it isn’t everything. It doesn’t teach you how to think.</span>I agree with "visual literacy isn't everything." but some people would argue that "doesn't teach you how to think" is a way to remain neutral, so readers would have different reactions/perspective toward one thing.
 </p> 
         <p class="eleven"><span class="ano">filtering the past; it’s a way of selecting what’s important to remember, shaping it and classifying it.</span>The process of selecting what's important and what's not is relatively subjective. It's at the hands of the historians.
